==================

All the documentation for Spec will be stored here
where a pier file stands for a chapter.

The documentation is written using [`Pillar`](http://smalltalkhub.com/#!/~Pier/Pillar) by **Damien Cassou**.

## Guidelines

Few tips to ease the collaboration using git.

1. One sentence per line: it helps the diff tools to provide more accurate output
2. While working on a chapter, do not hesitate branching: it provides a more accurate view of what is under construction.
3. Create a Pull Request for each branch: it will not be accepted until the original author says it's ready, but it will provide a support for review and feedback
